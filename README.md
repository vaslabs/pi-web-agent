# Description

This is a web-app agent for the raspberry pi. It allows you to interact easily with your Pi via your browser. 


# How to install

## Devs only

### Pre-requisites

- golang
- npm
- angular (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Back-End development
The service will be communicating via a websocket. To test the service without
FE you can use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-websocket-client/omalebghpgejjiaoknljcfmglgbpocdp/related?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog

#### Run app
```
make run-backend
```

#### Run tests

make test-backend
```

### Front-End development

Associate pi web agent address with the name `rpi` in `/etc/hosts`

For example:
```
192.168.0.12 rpi
```
(that name is used to proxy requests to your raspberry pi)

```
cd ui/pi-we-agent-app
npm start
```
